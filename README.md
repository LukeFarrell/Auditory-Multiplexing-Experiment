# Auditory-Multiplexing-Experiment

This experiment was supported by the Groh Neural Basis of Perception Labratory at Duke University and completed as a part of indepedent research that I conducted there from  2016-2017. The portion of the experiment included here was run on human subjects on a specially designed 8 auditory channel Windows Machine I built. 

The goal of the experiment was to determine the simultaneous localization capabilities of human subjects without the aid of frequency or loudness cues typically present in natural enviroments. Through this study _I tested over 100 subjects and collected around 20,000 experimental trails_. 

Preliminary analysis suggests a robust limitation on simultaneous location perception in humans for the first time with frequency and loudness disambiguated. Further evidence of a temporally dependent neural mechanism are currently being investigated in non-human primates as a part of the study. 

__Results are being presented at the Society for Neuroscience 2017 Washington D.C. meeting in November of 2017.
